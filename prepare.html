                  <p>One of the last things a new dog owner thinks about is puppy proofing your home.  Many foods that are common place for human consumption can be dangerous for dogs. It is best to stick with a dog food diet for your pet.</p>

                  <p>Some plants and household cleaners are particularly bad for dogs. Never take it for granted that dogs understand it is bad to eat chocolate or toilet bowl cleaner, what a dog chooses to eat may shock you.  Also watch how your dog plays with toys.  Some dogs are aggressive chewers and can destroy a dog toy, swallowing parts of it in a matter of minutes.</p>

                  <p>All puppies come with a few bad habits. First and foremost puppies chew, chew furniture, shoes and baseboards. You name it they will probably try to chew it. Puppies can be inquisitive and adventurous, be prepared to find your favorite plant unpotted or the dirty clothes dragged all over the house. They can also be scared by random sounds or actions. There are always solutions, chew toys and a safe zone where your puppy cannot get into mischief is a good place to start. Puppies also have sharp teeth and even the perfect pup will occasionally nip or bite before learning this is considered bad behavior. With the right coaching and patience, these bad habits will be short lived.</p>
