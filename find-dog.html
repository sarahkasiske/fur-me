            <p>Shelter dogs always come with many unknowns. A guess can be made about their breed but it is generally that, a guess. What breed a dog is will relate to its size and temperament so it is important to make sure you are ready to care for a dog without necessarily knowing its exact size or temperament. If you are allergic to dogs, it might be difficult to ensure a dog from a shelter is a hypoallergenic dog.</p>

            <p>If you do not have experience with dogs, working at a shelter might give you the insight you need to decide  whether adding a dog to your family is the right choice for you.  Shelters often have puppies as well as older dogs available for adoption.</p>

            <p>There are always many shelter dogs of all ages looking for good homes. A shelter dog could  be the perfect match for your family, but understand that shelter animals may come with special problems depending on their life experience. The best way to discover their personality is to spend time with them before making the decision to adopt.</p>

          <!-- Breeders -->
          <h2 id="breeders">Buying a Dog From a Breeder</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for a dog with a specific temperament or size, a breeder may be a good place to look. Although there are no guarantees, most breeders have an idea of the characteristics, personalities and size of the dogs they raise. Breeders work to insure the health of their puppies and know their medical history.</p>

            <p>As a potential owner, you should be able to ask a breeder about the puppy’s family history,  vaccination record and how the puppy has been socialized. If possible meet the parents of the puppy this will help you understand what  your puppy to be like as an adult dog. Spending  time with the puppy is always a good idea.</p>

            <p>Breeders often have questions for prospective dog owners. This is a sign of a responsible breeder, they are looking for a loving, responsible owner for their puppies. Information is available online about breeders. Consider visiting a kennel, meeting the breeder and see how the dogs and breeder interact. Breeders should be knowledgeable and able to answer your questions.</p>

            <p>Whether your dog is from a shelter or a kennel you should ask questions. It is advisable to find out the type and quantity of food the dog has been eating. Find out if your dog has been microchipped, no need to microchip twice. Ask about health issues, health records and a recommendation of a veterinarian. Shelters may have less information, but will share whatever information they have. A breeder should have answers and be a source of information for you, throughout your dog’s life.</p>
