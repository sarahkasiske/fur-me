              <h2>Millions of dogs are placed in shelters every year</h2>

              <p>Of the dogs brought to shelters, the majority are less than a year old, almost half had not been neutered/spayed, a third had never been to the vet and almost none, 96%, had no obedience training. Almost a third of these animals had been given to the owner by a friend but many were from breeders or shelters. A dog can be a wonderful addition to your family but make an educated decision, this should be a life long decision.</p>
