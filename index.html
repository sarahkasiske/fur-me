              <h2>Millions of Dogs are Placed in Shelters Every Year</h2>
              <p>Of the dogs brought to shelters, the majority are less than a year old, almost half have not been neutered/spayed, a third have never been to the vet and 96%, had no obedience training. Almost a third of these animals had been given to the owner by a friend but many were from breeders or shelters. A dog can be a wonderful addition to your family but it is important to make an educated decision, choosing to own a dog should be a long-term decision.</p>

                <h2>Make Sure Your Home Is a Dogs Forever Home</h2>
                <p>Before deciding to add a dog to your family do the research, and make a choice that is best for you, your family and the dog you plan to bring home. Add a dog to your family for life, not until they chew up your favorite pair of shoes.</p>
                <p>Think about the dog you are choosing to be part of your family.  Learning about dog breeds gives you insight into the characteristics of the dogs you are considering, this helps even with a mixed breed dog. Big, small, quiet, energetic, protective and friendly are all characteristics of different breeds. While nature contributes to many characteristics, nurture or how a dog is raised and trained also has influence on the dog your puppy becomes.</p>
